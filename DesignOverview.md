Applied statistics focusing on the fundamentals of experimental design and analysis of variance, 
which allows for the comparison of group means. In addition to the basic terminology and concepts 
behind experiments, students will learn about common experimental designs and how to analyze them. 
Such designs include completely randomized designs, factorial designs, randomized block designs, 
split plot designs, and repeated measures ANOVA.

Objectives:
o Explain and apply the fundamental principles of experiment design used to answer
research questions
o Analyze and interpret data collected using a designed experiment
o Choose an appropriate experimental design and its potential limitations for a given
research question
